## Local Development vs Production

### Development (Your PC):
- ✅ Easy testing and debugging
- ✅ No hosting costs
- ❌ Bot stops when PC is off
- ❌ Not accessible 24/7

### Production (Cloud):
- ✅ Runs 24/7
- ✅ Always accessible to users
- ✅ Professional deployment
- ❌ Requires setup (but it's easy!)

## Recommendation

**For Learning/Testing:** Keep running on your PC
**For Real Users:** Deploy to Railway or Heroku (both have free tiers)
